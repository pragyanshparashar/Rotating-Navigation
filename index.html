    <p>Batman[a] is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by

      philanthropist, and industrialist who resides in Gotham City. Batman's origin story features him swearing
      vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas and Martha as a child, a vendetta
      tempered with the ideal of justice.He trains himself physically and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona,
      and monitors the Gotham streets at night. Kane, Finger, and other creators.One of the most iconic characters in
      popular culture, Batman has been listed among the greatest comic book superheroes and fictional characters ever
      created. He is one of the most commercially successful superheroes, and his likeness has been licensed and
      featured in various media and merchandise sold around the world; this includes toy lines such as Lego Batman and
      video games like the Batman: Arkham series. Batman has been adapted in live-action and animated incarnations,
      including the 1960s Batman television series played by Adam West and in film by Michael Keaton in Batman (1989),
      Batman Returns (1992), and The Flash (2023), Val Kilmer in Batman Forever (1995), George Clooney in Batman and
      Robin (1997), Christian Bale in The Dark Knight trilogy (2005–2012), Ben Affleck in the DC Extended Universe

    <p>accompanied Batman with supporting characters, including his sidekicks Robin and Batgirl; allies Alfred
      Pennyworth, James Gordon, and Catwoman; and foes such as the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, and his archenemy,
      the Joker Kane conceived Batman in early 1939 to capitalize on the popularity of DC's Superman; although Kane
      frequently claimed sole creation credit, Finger substantially developed the concept from a generic superhero into
      something more bat-like. The character received his own spin-off publication, Batman, in 1940. Batman was
      originally introduced as a ruthless vigilante who frequently killed or maimed criminals, but evolved into a
      character with a stringent moral code and strong sense of justice. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not
      possess any superpowers, instead relying on his intellect, fighting skills, and wealth. The 1960s Batman
      television series used a camp aesthetic, which continued to be associated with the character for years after the
      show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his darker roots in the 1970s and 1980s,
      culminating with the 1986 miniseries The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller.

      DC has featured Batman in many comic books, including comics published under its imprints such as Vertigo and
      Black Label. The longest-running Batman comic, Detective Comics, is the longest-running comic book in the United
      States. Batman is frequently depicted alongside other DC superheroes, such as Superman and Wonder Woman, as a
      member of organizations such as the Justice League and the Outsiders. In addition to Bruce Wayne, other characters
      have taken on the Batman persona on different occasions, such as Jean-Paul Valley / Azrael in the 1993–1994
      "Knightfall" story arc; Dick Grayson, the first Robin, from 2009 to 2011; and Jace Fox, son of Wayne's ally
      Lucius, as of 2021.[4] DC has also published comics featuring alternate versions of Batman, including the
      incarnation seen in The Dark Knight Returns and its successors, the incarnation from the Flashpoint (2011) event,
      and numerous interpretations from Elseworlds stories.</p>
